# Bicycles project

This project uses Ionic + Express + Sequelize + Multer (uploads/downloads pictures).

It captures pictures in Ionic, and selects photos using Ionic Capacitor too.

## How to start

Create MySQL database and configure database in ionic-express-sequelize-multer-photos/backend/config/db.config.js

Download the frontend from here and put it in the project folder (decompress): https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Okhsor3FSNITEB8cJSiC9YoZAQa5UUi/view?usp=share_link

In order to install all dependencies in the backend, type the next commands in the terminal:

```
cd ionic-express-sequelize-multer-photos/backend
npm install
node index.js
```

In order to install all dependencies in the frontend, type the next commands in the terminal:

```
cd ionic-express-sequelize-multer-photos/frontend
npm install
ionic serve
```
