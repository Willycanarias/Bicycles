# Ionic + Express + Sequelize + Multer Example

This is a basic example using Ionic + Express + Sequelize + Multer that shows how to upload/download images using Multer.

It captures images in Ionic, and pick photos up as well using Ionic Capacitor.

## Getting Started

Create MySQL database and configure database in ionic-express-sequelize-multer-photos/backend/config/db.config.js

Install dependencies and run backend:

```
cd ionic-express-sequelize-multer-photos/backend
npm install
node index.js
```

Install dependencies and run frontend:

```
cd ionic-express-sequelize-multer-photos/frontend
npm install
ionic serve
```

Enjoy!
